            </h2>
            <p>
              In order to provide better service to you, we may collect general
              personal data (full or partial) such as your company's name,
              contact person, address, telephone number, mobile phone, fax

              information, nature of business, and product/service details of
              your company when you register an online account with us, use our
              services, attend our functions, or otherwise communicate with us.
              In some circumstances, we may also collect personal identification
              data such as your passport or identity card number, date of birth,
              and nationality for security and verification purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the data collection process, we may also occasionally collect
              personal information about individual contact persons of the
              companies or their employees. Separately, we may collect personal
              information of individuals in the course of and in relation to the
              provision of our services or products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where applicable, it is obligatory for you to supply those
              personal data indicated as mandatory on any data collection
              section posted on our website. If you do not supply such data, we
              may be unable to provide the requested service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, telephone calls made to and from us
              and/or our service hotlines and/or inquiry telephone numbers may
              be recorded for the purposes of proper record-keeping and/or
              preservation of evidence of communications. Unless expressly
              indicated otherwise at the time of calling, such recordings are
              NOT personal data of the caller and therefore, in respect of the
              caller, are not subject to the protection offered by applicable
              personal data privacy laws, and the caller has no rights and/or
              claims either statutory, contractual, or tortious, over or to such
              recorded data. However, we will at all times take care to protect
              such recordings from inadvertent and/or unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <p>
              We only retain personal data for as long as it is necessary for
              the fulfillment of the purpose (including any directly related
              purpose) for which the data is or is to be used and expressly
              permitted by law (not exceeding two years in ordinary cases),
              unless the personal data is required to be retained to satisfy any
              applicable statutory or contractual obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Occasionally, you may be required to provide personal data about
              other individuals to us (e.g., users whom you have used our
              services on their behalf). In such cases, for compliance with
              applicable laws, you are required to have first obtained the
              authorization of such individuals before using, disclosing, and
              transferring their personal data, including giving consent on
              their behalf to our possible use, disclosure, and transfer of
              their personal data, for the purposes you would want to achieve
              from us. If necessary, we may require you to provide us with any
              supporting document as may be necessary to prove such
              authorization. You should also advise them that we can be
              contacted for further information.
